Thank you for trying this Elkarte addon.  

If you leave the "Remove all data associated with this addon" [b]unchecked[/b] then there are a couple of things that will be left alone. 
	
	1) Any permissions you may have set for the mod 
	2) All the characters and tags that your members have created, as well as the information of what character was used to post which posts.
	
If you instead check that option, then all member data associated with this addon will also be removed
